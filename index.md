_**[10-Ks' Sentiment Score and How They Relate to Stock Fluctuation](/Report/Report.md/)**_

Are stocks from the S&P 500 dependent on 10k sentiment? Do certain categorical words have more impact?
In this study, we dive into the possibility that sentiment scores of 10k's can directly cause stocks
to increase or decrease relative to the time of when the 10k came out. Our dataset includes the S&P 500. 
Below is a heatmap that summarizes the corrleation between the stock changes (immediate stock change 
and long-term stock change) and the sentiment scores created from different theories and categories of 
sentiment scores. Click on the link above to see the detailed report to learn more.
