_**[10-Ks' Sentiment Score and How They Relate to Stock Fluctuation](/Report/Report.md/)**_

Are stocks from the S&P 500 dependent on 10k sentiment? Do certain categorical words have more impact?
In this study, we dive into the possibility that sentiment scores of 10k's can directly cause stocks
to increase or decrease relative to the time of when the 10k came out. Our dataset includes the S&P 500. 
Below is a heatmap that summarizes the corrleation between the stock changes (immediate stock change 
and long-term stock change) and the sentiment scores created from different theories and categories of 
sentiment scores. Click on the link above to see the detailed report to learn more.

_**[There Is Such A Thing As Free Lunch](https://github.com/tobeybill/TISATAFL)**_

This team project analyzes the relationship between firm performance and CEO/Board of Director Compensation. Our analysis includes companies from the S&P 500 separated into size categories based on market value. For each firm, we ran a Ridge regression to predict firm CEO/BOD over/under compensation percentages. After achieving this metric, we calculated a measure of firm performance using the coefficients of a linear regression as weights for each relevant variable. Once both over/under compensation and firm performance had been calculated for the firms in question, the two were correlated, plotted on a scatterplot, and then average firm performance was listed in comparison with the four cases of over/undercompensation.

_**[Analyzing Bank of the West Lending Practice Paper](/pdf/BMO FinTech Capstone Report.pdf)**_

Historically, redlining prevented residents of specific areas from accessing credit due to race or ethnicity. Today, government regulations prevent financial institutions from making lending decisions based on an applicant's demographic attributes. As the Bank of Montreal (BMO), the sponsor financial institution of the Spring 2023 Lehigh Fintech Capstone class,  completed its acquisition of Bank of the West in February 2023, this paper conducts a comprehensive examination of the lending behaviors of Bank of the West and reports our findings to personnel at the Bank of Montreal.
Specifically, this paper analyzes the lending behaviors of Bank of the West (BOW) in Arizona and California using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) loan-level data and Census tract demographic information for 2021. The analysis aims to help BMO Harris (which recently acquired Bank of the West) understand if BOW's lending falls short of BMO Harris's goal to serve underserved communities and steps BMO Harris can take to address any shortcomings. The analysis uses maps, regression models, and an experiment with OpenAI's ChatGPT API to assess the impact of demographic information on loan decisions.

_**[MagFO](/pdf/Beerliminator.pdf)**_

Our team worked with representatives from MagFO to find a market for their Magnesium Forward Osmosis System. Our research directed us to the dealcholization of beer. This is a rapidly growing market and the process of the MagFO system would be most beneficial to all the brewers who are attempting to create a new product for non-alcholic drinkers.
